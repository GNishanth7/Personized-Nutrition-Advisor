#Abstract

The AI-assisted personalized nutrition recommendations project aims to develop a personalized nutrition recommendation system that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms 
to analyze an individual's health status, lifestyle, and dietary preferences and provide personalized recommendations based on their goals and dietary requirements. The system utilizes food 
databases and nutrition APIs to retrieve information about the nutrient content of various foods and meals, and provides users with a web  interface to view their personalized recommendations and 
track their progress towards their goals.This project has the potential to revolutionize the field of nutrition and provide individuals with more accurate and effective tools to improve their health and well-being.
